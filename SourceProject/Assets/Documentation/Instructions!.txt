AI SCENE 
Play around with the health and ammo values as the AI runs, AI will run to health and ammo packs 
if it needs to. It will also only go to packs it has seen, as well as the closest, so fiddle around 
with moving the health packs to test this. 

AI HIDE SCENE
AI may glitch out if it stops in between the two structures.
Depending what angle you come at, the AI works perfectly and runs away from player, less often
it may choose to path past the player, play around with coming at the AI from different angles
for best demonstration.
